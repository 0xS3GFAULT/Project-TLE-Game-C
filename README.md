# The Last Engineer

I had the opportunity to work on a big project in C language made in 3 months with my team during my studies in engineering school.

The Last Engineer is a tower defense game where you're a lost engineering on a planet, and you need to defend yourself from enemies by building turrets and placing them strategically.

## How to run the game ?

Prerequisites : **libSDL2**

You can download it on Gnu/Linux with `sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev`.
